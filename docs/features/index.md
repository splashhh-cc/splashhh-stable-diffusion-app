        [WebUI Hotkeys Reference Guide](WEBUIHOTKEYS.md)

    -   The [Unified Canvas](UNIFIED_CANVAS.md)

        Build complex scenes by combine and modifying multiple images in a
        stepwise fashion. This feature combines img2img, inpainting and
        outpainting in a single convenient digital artist-optimized user
        interface.

    -   The [Command Line Interface (CLI)](CLI.md)

        Scriptable access to InvokeAI's features.

-   Image Generation

    -   [Prompt Engineering](PROMPTS.md)

        Get the images you want with the InvokeAI prompt engineering language.

    -   [Post-Processing](POSTPROCESS.md)

        Restore mangled faces and make images larger with upscaling. Also see
        the [Embiggen Upscaling Guide](EMBIGGEN.md).

    -   The [Concepts Library](CONCEPTS.md)

        Add custom subjects and styles using HuggingFace's repository of
        embeddings.

    -   [Image-to-Image Guide for the CLI](IMG2IMG.md)

        Use a seed image to build new creations in the CLI.

    -   [Inpainting Guide for the CLI](INPAINTING.md)

        Selectively erase and replace portions of an existing image in the CLI.

    -   [Outpainting Guide for the CLI](OUTPAINTING.md)

        Extend the borders of the image with an "outcrop" function within the
        CLI.

    -   [Generating Variations](VARIATIONS.md)

        Have an image you like and want to generate many more like it?
        Variations are the ticket.

-   Model Management

    -   [Model Installation](../installation/050_INSTALLING_MODELS.md)

        Learn how to import third-party models and switch among them. This guide
        also covers optimizing models to load quickly.

    -   [Merging Models](MODEL_MERGING.md)

        Teach an old model new tricks. Merge 2-3 models together to create a new
        model that combines characteristics of the originals.

    -   [Textual Inversion](TEXTUAL_INVERSION.md)

        Personalize models by adding your own style or subjects.

-   Other Features

    -   [The NSFW Checker](NSFW.md)

        Prevent InvokeAI from displaying unwanted racy images.

    -   [Miscellaneous](OTHER.md)

        Run InvokeAI on Google Colab, generate images with repeating patterns,
        batch process a file of prompts, increase the "creativity" of image
        generation by adding initial noise, and more!
